# OSG David Swanson Award

The OSG David Swanson Award was established to honor our late colleague, David Swanson. David contributed to campus research across the country, through the advancement of DHTC and the Open Science Grid. 

Brian Bockelman, who was mentored by David, noted that David was the founding director of the Holland Computing Center at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln and a tireless advocate for the Open Science Grid.  Through his leadership, Nebraska went from simple “users” of the OSG to having team members become part of the OSG management.  David himself ultimately went on to become the OSG Council Chair in 2015 (JLS: he was council chair in 2015 -is this the start date) and helped steer the OSG through his calm, steady influence.  Beyond his formal appointments, he was a close friend and mentor to many in the OSG community and always available to provide well-needed insight and thoughts to others.

David passed away in an accident in fall 2019 and, in his memory the award is bestowed annually upon one or more former students of the OSG User School who have subsequently achieved significant DHTC-enabled research outcomes, and covers the recipient's costs of attending the OSG All-Hands Meeting to present their work. Of course, given the pandemic, we will welcome awardees from 2020 and 2021 at the next in-person meeting. In the meantime their work was presented virtually at the 2020 and 2021 All-Hands Meeting.  

In March 2021, two David Swanson Award winners presented: Jon Li, a 2020  award recipient, who was unavailable to speak when the All Hands Meeting was rescheduled from March to September 2020 due to the pandemic, and this year's 2021 recipient, Nicholas Cooley.

John Li, of the University of Wisconsin-Madison. attended the OSG User School in 2019 and quickly accelerated in his use of high throughput computing, whether running via a campus access point or on the Open Science Pool via an OSG Connect access point.

We'll next hear from Nick Cooley, this year's recipient of the David Swanson Award, who attended the OSG User School in 2018. Since that time, Nick and his group at the University of Pittsburgh have undertaken a number of projects benefiting from DHTC and OSG capabilities, with more than 2 million hours of compute usage on the Open Science Pool in the last year. Congratulations, Nick! We look forward to learning more about you and your work.



The award is bestowed annually upon one or more former participants of the OSG User School
who have subsequently achieved significant DHTC-enabled research outcomes.
In addition to the honor of the award itself, the only of its kind in the OSG,
the award also covers the recipient’s costs of attending
the OSG All-Hands Meeting to present their work.
