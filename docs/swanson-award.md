# OSG David Swanson Award

The OSG David Swanson Award was established to honor our late colleague,
David Swanson, who died in a car collision in August 2019.
David contributed to campus research across the country,
through the advancement of DHTC and the Open Science Grid.

The award is bestowed annually upon one or more former participants of the OSG User School
who have subsequently achieved significant DHTC-enabled research outcomes.
In addition to the honor of the award itself, the only of its kind in the OSG,
the award also covers the recipient’s costs of attending
the OSG All-Hands Meeting to present their work.
